MATLAB scripts used for data analysis to make computations about the formed figure-8 user trajectory, to eventually calculate the correct manipulator measurements and parameters. 

##### Note

Every script has a directory with input format mentioned in its README file. For data files of a certain script, please feel free to email me.
